# Relation_memory_task_3D
<br /><br />
I share the code of a Unity3D-based memory task, where human participants memorize a sequence of non-sense characters, and use mouse to connect the characters sequentially. In each experimental session, participants learn the sequence constituted by 4 unique characters in advance. Lately, they performed 120 trials in the session with each trial requiring 4 mouse clicks (connecting 3 pairs, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4).
<br /><br />

The location of characters were pseudorandomly arranged to ensure 



we appreciate the non-sense characters used by the present study, which are supported by [Omniglot dataset ](https://www.omniglot.com/)
