# Relation_memory_task_3D
<br />
I share the code of a Unity3D-based memory task, where human participants memorize a sequence of non-sense characters, and use mouse to connect the characters sequentially. 
<br />
In each experimental session, participants first learn the sequence composed of 4 distinct characters, and complete 120 trials underlying the sequence in the session with each trial necessitating 4 mouse clicks to connect three pairs based on their relations (e.g., A to B, B to C, and C to D).

<br />

The location of characters were pseudorandomly arranged to ensure 




we appreciate the non-sense characters used by the present study, which are supported by [Omniglot dataset ](https://www.omniglot.com/)
