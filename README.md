# Relation_memory_task_3D
<br />

I share the code of a Unity3D-based memory task, where human participants memorize a sequence of non-sense characters, and use mouse to connect the characters sequentially. 
<br /><br />

The aim of the study is to explore the principles that how knowledges are encoded by periodic representation (amplitude, frequency, and phase) of neural population over the brain. We therefore used Magnetoencephalography(MEG), which offers ideal spatial-temporal resolution. 
<br /><br />

In each experimental session of the task, participants first learn the sequence composed of 4 distinct characters, and complete 120 trials underlying the sequence in the session with each trial necessitating 4 mouse clicks to connect three pairs based on their relations (e.g., A to B, B to C, and C to D). The location of characters were pseudorandomly arranged across the 120 trials, this procedure ensures that the movement directions of mouse movement in each relation pair cover 0°-360° on screen space as evenly as possible with a step size of 3°。 
<br /><br />

So far, I collected 13 human participants and currently conducting data mining works with the goal listed below:<br />
1. examine whether a hexagonal codes on spatial-temporal space could be found (done)
2. 
<br /><br />



We appreciate the non-sense characters used by the present study, which are supported by [Omniglot dataset ](https://www.omniglot.com/)
