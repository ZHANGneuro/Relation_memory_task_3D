# Relation_memory_task_3D
<br /><br />
I share the code of a Unity3D-based memory task, where human participants memorize a sequence of non-sense characters (4 unique characters in each experimental session), and use mouse to connect the characters sequentially.
<br /><br />



we appreciate the non-sense characters used by the present study, which are supported by [Omniglot dataset ](https://www.omniglot.com/)
